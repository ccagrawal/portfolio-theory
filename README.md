## Introduction to Porfolio Theory

Description: This app demonstrates basic portfolio theory. The user inputs the tickers of several assets, and the app plots all the possible portfolios on a risk/reward graph. From these portfolios, an efficient frontier is created.

This app was created by Chirag Agrawal for Professor John Griffin's FIN 367 (Investments Management) course at The University of Texas at Austin.
